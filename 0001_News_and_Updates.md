The public repo is no longer updated but we have our successful private repo for that ;-)

14. October 2021: Nun machen sie die Typen mit ihren illegalen Streams so richtig lächerlich. Da hat der Vollpfosten  @LaneSh4d0w doch tatsächlich einen Eintrag in der Blacklist gemacht. Aber Streams wie Disney-Channels, Sky Sportkanäle, deutsches privates TV (1 Eintrag) sind weiterhin in deren Schrottlisten enthalten. Naja, bald wird dieser unseriöse haufen eh sein zweites DMCA bekommen, denn bei denen ist so einiges NICHT legal!

12. July2021: Since there is no end to the hate campaign and the spreading of lies about our repo and also against me, there will soon be major changes here (also in the public repo). It's really just pathetic what some people post there and that will be the reason for changes. After that, I laugh last. WE have 5161 really legal and free streams. Anyone looking for Disney channels or other steams from PAY-TV will have to go to the provider that MH is now even advertising in its addon. I can only shake my head and laugh at the same time.

I'm not just talking, I have proof. Pay TV and other paid streams into a free repo!!!!
I think it won't be long now with these repo until the next DMCA. MH is now even advertising in one of his addons, it´s unbelievable.

Disney Channel Spain - PAY-TV!

And for a special guy in NZ!I don´t copy, i find the streams self with an Samsung TV of a friend and with tools to find subdomains!!!! In your m3u's are ONLY the crappy URL's from amazonaws.com in it, which have constantly dropouts! I have the streams from wurl and amagi, they run clean! Why is:

-TOP FILM DE
-KINO DE
-DEUTSCHES KINO DE
-ROMANCE DE 

and some others not in your lists??? Why are they NOT in your lists, you are supposed to be so good! They have been in our m3´s for a longer time! Haha...

2 Examples, Subdomains and the correct stream address (DK and DE):

Subdomain;rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv
Correct stream: https://rakuten-gratis-topfilm-1-eu.rakuten.wurl.tv/playlist.m3u8
Subdomain: travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com
Correct stream: https://travelxp-travelxp-2-de.samsung.wurl.com/manifest/playlist.m3u8

and so on. It is similar with Amagi.TV! So... fuck you and don't talk that bullshit about copy your stocking streams from amazonaws.com!

Just stop posting lies about our repo, in the long run you are ONLY hurting yourself! And... Never going to give you up... Haha... 

Have a good week

11-July 2021: Important changes in all files, it is not an update of the streams!

Some well-known island monkeys think they are so clever. Now the laughter is on my side again. The IPTV-Merge add-on from MH now works again with all m3u's. A warm greeting to MH Haha.... "Never going to give you up"... to change your code and harm the users of FREE-IPTV.... Haha... 

Here is the thread of the intellectual lowlifes:

Have a good sunday! Haha...

# 20. June 2021: Since our successful repo is only available to select members, some have been very quiet with their updates.... Haha. No one steals our work anymore to make a name for themselves without citing US as the source. Very special greetings go to IPTV-ORG, iptvmate.net, glotze.fndriven.de, our special friend MAGGY (Forum vuplus-support.org) and so some other clowns.
